## :white_large_square: FOREWORD
I completed a case study on **Cyclistic** bike-share for my Google Data Analytics certification, inspired by my passion for cycling. This project, my first in analytics, explores the differences between casual and member riders following Google's framework: **Ask**, **Prepare**, **Process**, **Analyze**, **Share**, **Act**.

## :white_large_square: INTRODUCTION
Cyclistic, founded in 2016, operates a vast fleet of over 16,500 bicycles covering 190 square miles in Chicago. The bikes, strategically located across 800 stations in the city, cater to urban riders with diverse heights and abilities, boasting a design focused on comfort and stability. Users can unlock bikes at any station and return them to any other station at their convenience.

Initially, Cyclistic's marketing aimed at raising general awareness and appealing to a diverse audience with various pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders are those opting for short-term passes, whereas annual memberships are purchased by Cyclistic members.

Financial analysis indicates annual members generate more profit than casual riders. To capitalize on this, Moreno, Cyclistic's director of marketing, prioritizes converting casual riders into members rather than attracting new customers. The strategy revolves around understanding the differences between these groups, why casual riders might switch to memberships, and the role of digital media in marketing.

Maximizing annual memberships is key to Cyclistic's future success, prompting Moreno's team to analyze historical trip data to uncover trends. As their recommendations necessitate executive approval, they must provide compelling data insights and professional visualizations.
