## :white_large_square: FOREWORD
I completed a case study on **Cyclistic** bike-share for my Google Data Analytics certification, inspired by my passion for cycling. This project, my first in analytics, explores the differences between casual and member riders following Google's framework: **Ask**, **Prepare**, **Process**, **Analyze**, **Share**, **Act**.
